                   implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble
                   sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed
                   by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source
                   and has already been used in several published
                   projects in the astrophysics literature. The
                   algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over
                   traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has
                   excellent performance as measured by the
                   autocorrelation time (or function calls per
                   independent sample). One major advantage of the
                   algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1
                   or 2 parameters compared to ~N2 for a traditional
                   algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In
                   this document, we describe the algorithm and the
                   details of our implementation. Exploiting the
                   parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any
                   user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without
                   extra effort. The code is available online at

  year =          {2010},
  abstract =      {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for
                   model assessment, model comparison, convergence
                   diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In
                   this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in
                   using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent
                   problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can
                   only be estimated for linear models. Concerning
                   nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is
                   unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the
                   value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise
                   in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared
                   itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is
                   uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of
                   reduced chi-squared for differentiating between
                   models or assessing convergence of a minimisation
                   procedure. The impact of noise on the value of
                   reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in
                   particular for small data sets, which are very common
                   in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced
                   chi-squared can only be used with due caution for
                   linear models, whereas it must not be used for
                   nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more
                   sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also
                   applicable to nonlinear models.},

  abstract =      {Estimating errors is a crucial part of any scientific
                   analysis. Whenever a parameter is estimated
                   (model-based or not), an error estimate is necessary.
                   Any parameter estimate that is given without an error
                   estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many
                   (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach
                   such methods for error estimation to themselves when
                   working scientifically for the first time. This
                   manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of
                   different methods for error estimation that are
                   applicable to both model-based and model-independent
                   parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed
                   in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and
                   their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the
                   methods for error estimation discussed are grid
                   search, varying $\chi^2$, the Fisher matrix,
                   Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data
                   resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is
                   outlined how to propagate measurement errors through
                   complex data-reduction pipelines.},
